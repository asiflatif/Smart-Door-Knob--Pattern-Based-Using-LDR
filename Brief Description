Description:
*The System will work only when the button is kept pressed.
*The pattern is set in the form of change in displacement of a set distance.
*The rotation of the knob initiates a mechanical gear rotation, resulting in back-and-forth movement of a slit.
*The sonar sensor measures the distance of the back and forth movement of the knob when the door knob is rotated.
*Predefined values of distance are set so that when the knob is rotated, the slit moves, the sonar sensor records a distance, if it matches the operator will have to turn the knob within 1 sec to rotate at an different angle.
*For experimental purpose the blue LED lights up when first rotation angle matches, then within 1 sec if second rotation angle matches, the red LED lights up along with the servo being rotated.
